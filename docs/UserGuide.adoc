== Features

In this section, we will be introducing you to the various features of PTMan, and their respective  commands.
Our features would be split into 3 sub-sections, <<Shared Features>>, <<Employer Features>>, and <<Employee Features>>. +
Take note that for this user guide, our commands will follow the format as stated in Command Format below.

e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
