== Introduction

Part-Time Manager (PTMan) is an application made for companies to manage their part-timers and their respective working schedules.
PTMan allows managers to easily schedule work shifts and keep track of their employees' information.
It also allows the part-timers to have the flexibility of choosing their own working schedules by applying for the available shifts.
The primary mode of interaction with PTMan is via keyboard commands, so if you are a proficient typist, then you will feel right at home using PTMan!
 +

This user guide comes with comprehensive instructions and examples of the various features to help you get started.
Sounds great? Jump straight to <<Quick Start, Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Here are the steps required to get PTMan up and running on your computer:

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download the latest `PTMan.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for PTMan.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The graphical user interface (GUI) as seen in _<<fig-Startup>>_ should appear in a few seconds.
+
[[fig-Startup]]
.Successful start up window
image::Ui_startup.png[width="790"]
.  Type a command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

[NOTE]
You may refer to <<Commands>> for more details of the available commands.

[IMPORTANT]
If you are a manager, you have access to <<Admin Mode, admin mode>>. Admin mode allows you to access all the <<Manager Commands, manager commands>>.
To prevent unauthorized access, please change your default admin mode password using the `changeadminpw` command.
You may refer to <<Changing admin password: `changeadminpw`>> for instructions on how to do so.

[[Features]]
== Features
In this section, we will be introduce you to the various features of PTMan.

=== User Authentication
PTMan has user authentication for both managers and employees to prevent unauthorized execution of <<Commands, commands>>.

Managers can refer to <<Admin mode>> for admin authentication, while employees can refer to <<Employee password>> for employee authentication.

==== Admin mode
For managers, admin mode allows you to access all the <<Manager Commands, manager commands>> in PTMan.
To enter admin mode, please refer to <<Logging in to admin mode: `login`>>.
// TODO: SCREENSHOT
[NOTE]
The default admin password is `DEFAULT1`.

[IMPORTANT]
It is crucial to change the default admin password to prevent unauthorized access to admin mode.
You may refer to <<Changing admin password: `changeadminpw`>> for instructions on how to do so.

==== Employee password
For employees, your employee password identifies you and authorizes you to execute employee commands.
It ensures that when executing a command such as <<Applying for a shift: `apply`, `apply`>>, that you are applying yourself, and not someone else, for the shift.

[NOTE]
The default employee password is `DEFAULT1`.

[IMPORTANT]
It is crucial to change the default employee password to prevent unauthorized execution of employee commands.
You may refer to <<Changing employee password: `cp`>> for instructions on how to do so.

=== Timetable
PTMan has a timetable that displays all the shifts in a weekly format. There are many interactions between the
timetable and you, as a user, so this section aims to familiarise you with the timetable.

==== Shift Colors

The shifts in PTMan are color-coded, and here is what the different colors mean:

* Green: Shift is available with multiple slots left.
* Yellow: Shift is available, but slots are running out.
* Red: Shift is no longer available, slots for the shift have run out.
* Blue: Shift is taken up by currently selected employee.
* Brown: Shift is not taken up by currently selected employee.

_<<fig-Feature_Timetable1>>_ below shows how the default timetable can look like in PTMan. +
 +
[[fig-Feature_Timetable1]]
.A Sample Timetable with Shifts +
image::Feature_Timetable1.png[width="790"]

PTMan also allows employees to view their own shifts using the <<Displaying an employee’s shifts on the timetable: `select`, `select`>> command.
_<<fig-Feature_Timetable2>>_ shows how the timetable can look like when an employee is selected.
 +
[[fig-Feature_Timetable2]]
.A Sample Timetable with Shifts after `select` +
image::Feature_Timetable2.png[width="790"]

==== Timetable Navigation

There are two ways to navigate through the different weeks in the timetable:

. Using Keyboard Shortcuts
+
* For Windows:
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[->] : Navigates timetable to the next week.
** kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[<-] : Navigates timetable to the previous week.
* For Mac:
** kbd:[Command] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[->] : Navigates timetable to the next week.
** kbd:[Command] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[<-] : Navigates timetable to the previous week.
. Using Mouse Clicks
+
* At the top of the timetable, there is a navigation bar with two arrow buttons which you can click on.
These buttons `<` and `>` navigates the timetable to the previous and next week respectively.
_<<fig-Feature_Timetable3>>_ below shows the navigation bar, with the two arrow buttons circled. +
+
[[fig-Feature_Timetable3]]

image::Feature_Timetable3.png[width="790"]

=== Shift Management
If you are a manager, PTMan allows you to manage your employees' work shifts.
The timetable automatically displays the shifts in the current week, allowing you and your employees to easily view the shifts.

If you are an employee, PTMan gives you flexibility in your working hours by allowing you to apply for shifts that you wish to work in.

=== Outlet Management
// TODO: Introduce the outlet + screenshot

=== Saving the data

All data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files

All data is automatically encrypted after any command that changes the data.
PTMan will decrypt the data when reading from local files. There is no need to encrypt and decrypt manually.

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Keeping track of employees' monthly salaries [Coming in v2.0]

As employees work, their pay is calculated based on the hours they have worked.
The manager can use this information to distribute their salaries.

=== Saving data to the cloud [Coming in v2.0]

Currently, PTMan is meant to be used on a single shared device as it is limited by local storage.
By saving PTMan's data to the cloud, both employees and managers can access PTMan from their own devices since the data can be shared.

== Commands
Our commands are split into 3 sub-sections, <<Manager Commands, Manager Commands>>, <<Employee Commands, Employee Commands>>, and <<General Commands, General Commands>>. +
Take note that for this user guide, our commands will follow the format as stated below.

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. +
e.g. In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. +
e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times, or none at all. +
e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order. +
e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* For your convenience, many commands have an alias. +
eg. `list` and `l` will both show a list of all employees in PTMan.
====

=== Manager Commands
As a manager, you are able to access these commands in addition to the <<General Commands, general commands>>.
These manager commands require logging in to <<Admin Mode, admin mode>> as shown in <<Logging in to admin mode: `login`>>.
