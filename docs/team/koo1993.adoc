== PROJECT: Part-time Manager (PTMan)

== Overview

PTMan is a desktop human resource application used for managing part-time employees. +

PTMan aims to give part-time employees the freedom of choosing when they want to work by registering for the available shifts set by the employer.
Thereby reducing the hassle of work scheduling for both employers and employees. +

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *access control* that manages functions for employer and employee. [https://github.com/CS2103JAN2018-W14-B2/main/issues/39[Issue #39]]
** What it does:
*** Assigns password to each employer and employee.
*** Separates command for employer and employee.
*** Implements API for password checking that needs password.
*** Implements Login/Logout to admin mode for employer to use admin commands at ease.
*** Implements Change/reset password for both group of user with email service.
** Justification: This ensure only authenticated personnel can use the system and restrict employee to use functions that are meant for the employer. This prevent misuse of PTMan.
